                response: "Robert and Jennifer are both partially correct. You can make a request for the site to be white-listed, or simply look for the information you need on another site, but I'd also like to suggest that you consider the reasoning given by the firewall as to why the site has been blacklisted/banned. If the firewall says that it's banned for being a 'malicious site' you should really be considering if the site is safe to be using on your own device at all."
